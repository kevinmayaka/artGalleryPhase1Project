        <h2>Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1</h2>
        <p>
          Whistler’s Mother, or Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1, as it’s
          actually titled, speaks to the artist’s ambition to pursue art for
          art’s sake. James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted the work in his
          London studio in 1871, and in it, the formality of portraiture becomes
          an essay in form. Whistler’s mother Anna is pictured as one of several
          elements locked into an arrangement of right angles. Her severe
          expression fits in with the rigidity of the composition, and it’s
          somewhat ironic to note that despite Whistler’s formalist intentions,
          the painting became a symbol of motherhood.

        <h2>The Arnolfini Portrait</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most significant works produced during the Northern
          Renaissance, this composition is believed to be one of the first
          paintings executed in oils. A full-length double portrait, it
          reputedly portrays an Italian merchant and a woman who may or may not
          be his bride. In 1934, the celebrated art historian Erwin Panofsky
          proposed that the painting is actually a wedding contract.
